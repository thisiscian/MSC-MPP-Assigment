SERIAL
======
The serial program can be run with  `make srun'.
Input variables can be modified in the "src/Makefile" folder
These include:
	Location for executable files
	Name of executable files
	Location of input files
	Location for output files	
	Type of Limiting factor
		0 - the number of iterations will be the limitting factor
		1 - the maximum change in all pixels will be the limitting factor
	Value of Limiting factor

PARALLEL
========

Parallel code can be run with `make prun'
Input variables are the same as the serial program, but also include
	The Number of threads

SUBMISSION
==========

Submitting to Morar is simple, just type `./submit'
Log files are output to a log folder, within the normal output file
Output is parsed with `awk' to output a file with number of threads, iterations, runtime and last max difference

OTHER
=====
	running `make' will compile both parallel and serial codes
	running `make run' will compile and run both parallel and serial
	running `make clean' will clean the area of most files (including submission logs)
